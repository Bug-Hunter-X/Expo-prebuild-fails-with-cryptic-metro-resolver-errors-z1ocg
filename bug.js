This error typically occurs when using Expo's `expo prebuild` command and involves the `metro-resolver` module, which is responsible for resolving module dependencies in React Native projects.  The error message might not explicitly state `metro-resolver`, but it points to issues within the module resolution process. This can manifest as cryptic errors during the prebuild step, often related to missing or misconfigured modules or paths. For example, you might see errors suggesting that the resolver cannot find certain packages or that it's encountering unexpected module structures.
