The solution usually involves careful debugging and investigation of the project's structure and dependencies.  There isn't a single, universally applicable fix. Strategies for resolving this issue include:

1. **Verify package.json:** Double-check that all dependencies in your `package.json` are correct and up-to-date. Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to ensure all dependencies are properly installed.
2. **Check Module Import Paths:** Examine your codebase for any incorrect or relative module import paths that might be causing the resolver to fail. Ensure absolute paths are used where necessary.
3. **Resolve Version Conflicts:** Use tools like `npm-check-updates` or similar to identify outdated packages and resolve any version conflicts.
4. **Clean Expo Cache:**  Execute `expo prebuild --clean` to clear the Expo CLI cache, which can sometimes resolve issues caused by stale cached data.
5. **Examine Error Messages Carefully:** The error messages, even if cryptic, often provide clues about the problematic module or path. Use these clues to guide your debugging efforts.
6. **Simplify Your Project:** If you're working on a large project, try creating a minimal reproducible example to isolate the source of the problem.
